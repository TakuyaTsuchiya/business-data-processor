============================================
IMPORTANT: EXTRACT ZIP FILE FIRST!
============================================

DO NOT run directly from ZIP file!

CORRECT STEPS:
1. Right-click the ZIP file
2. Select "Extract All..." (NOT "Open")
3. Choose extraction location (Desktop recommended)
4. Click "Extract"
5. Open the EXTRACTED folder
6. Double-click startup.bat

WRONG WAY:
- Double-clicking ZIP and running from inside
- Running from Windows temporary folder

IF YOU SEE THIS ERROR:
"[ERROR] app.py not found!"
or
"[ERROR] Running from temporary folder!"

It means you didn't extract the ZIP properly.
